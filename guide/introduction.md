# NEST

*Strongly typed Elasticsearch client*

NEST aims to be a .net client with a very concise API. 

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

Indexing is as simple as:

    var post = new Post() { Id = 12, ... }
    client.Index(post);

Indexing asynchronously is as easy as:

Searching is fluid:

	var results = this.ConnectedClient.Search<ElasticSearchProject>(s => s
			.From(0)
			.Size(10)
			.Fields(f => f.Id, f => f.Name)
			.SortAscending(f => f.LOC)
			.SortDescending(f => f.Name)
			.Query(q=>q.Term(f=>f.Name, "NEST", Boost: 2.0))
	);
