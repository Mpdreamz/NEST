# Connecting
This section describes how to instantiate a client and have it connect to the server.

## Choosing the right connection strategy

`NEST` follows pretty much the same design as `Elasticsearch.Net` when it comes to choosing 
the right [connection strategy](/elasticsearch-net/connecting.html)

    var uri = new Uri("http://mynode.somewhere.com/");
    var settings = new ConnectionSettings(uri, defaultIndex: "my-application");

This will create a non failover client that talks with `http://mynode.somewhere.com` and uses the default index name `my-application`
 for calls which do not explicitly state an index name. Specifying a default index is optional but [very handy](/nest/type-index-inference).

If you want a failover client instead of passing a `Uri` pass an `IConnectionPool` see the [Elasticsearch.Net documentation on cluster failover](/elasticsearch-net/cluster-failover.html) all of its implementations can also be used with NEST.



## Changing the underlying connection 

By default NEST will use HTTP to chat with elasticsearch, alternative implementation of the transport layer can be injected using the constructors optional second parameter

	var client = new ElasticClient(settings, new ThriftConnection(settings));

NEST comes with an Http Connection `HttpConnection`, Thrift Connection `ThriftConnection` 
and an In-Memory Connection `InMemoryConnection`, that nevers hits elasticsearch.

## Settings

The `NEST` client can be configured by passing in an `IConnectionSettingsValues` object, this interface is a subclass of 
`Elasticsearch.Net`'s `IConnectionConfigurationValues` so all the settings that can be used to 
[configure Elasticsearch.Net](/elasticsearch-net/connection.html) also apply here including the 
[cluster failover settings](/elasticsearch-net/cluster-failover.html)

The easiest way to pass `IConnectionSettingsValues` is to instantiate `ConnectionSettings`

    var settings = new ConnectionSettings(myConnectionPool, defaultIndex: "my-application")
        .PluralizeTypeNames();

####AddContractJsonConverters
Add a custom JsonConverter to the built in JSON serialization by passing
in a predicate for a type.  This way they will be part of the cached Json.NET contract for a type.

    settings.AddContractJsonConverters(t => 
        typeof (Enum).IsAssignableFrom(t) 
            ? new StringEnumConverter() 
            : null);

####MapDefaultTypeIndices
Map types to a index names. Takes precedence over SetDefaultIndex().

####MapDefaultTypeNames
Allows you to override typenames, takes priority over the global SetDefaultTypeNameInferrer()

####PluralizeTypeNames
This calls SetDefaultTypenameInferrer with an implementation that will pluralize
type names. This used to be the default prior to Nest 1.0

####SetDefaultIndex
Index to default to when no index is specified.

####SetDefaultPropertyNameInferrer
By default NEST camelCases property names (EmailAddress => emailAddress)
that do not have an explicit propertyname either via an ElasticProperty attribute
or because they are part of a Dictionary where the keys should be treated verbatim.
Here you can register a function that transforms propertynames (default
casing, pre- or suffixing)

####SetDefaultTypeNameInferrer
Allows you to override how type names should be represented, the default will
call .ToLowerInvariant() on the type's name.

####SetJsonSerializerSettingsModifier
Allows you to update the internal Json.NET Serializer settings to your liking.
Do not use this to add custom JSON converters use `AddContractJsonConverters` instead.
