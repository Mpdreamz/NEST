# Top Children Query

The top_children query runs the child query with an estimated hits size, and out of the hit docs, aggregates it into parent docs. If there arenâ€™t enough parent docs matching the requested from/size search request, then it is run again with a wider (more hits) search.

The top_children also provide scoring capabilities, with the ability to specify max, sum or avg as the score type.

Simple example:

	.TopChildren<Person>(fz => fz
		.Query(qq=>qq.Term(f=>f.FirstName, "john"))
		.Scope("my_scope")
	)

Custom scoring

	.TopChildren<Person>(fz => fz
		.Query(qq => qq.Term(f => f.FirstName, "john"))
		.Score(TopChildrenScore.avg)
		.Scope("my_scope")
		.Type("sillypeople")
	)
