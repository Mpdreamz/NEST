# Handling responces

All responses have the following properties

a boolean `IsValid` and a `ConnectionStatus` object that holds any information needed to recreate the request to elasticsearch.

These properties pertain to NEST and whether NEST thinks the response is valid or not. In some cases though elasticsearch responds back with with an `ok` or `acknowledged` properties. NEST will **always** map these fields but they will not influence the `IsValid` property. If NEST was successful in connecting and getting back a 200 status `IsValid` will always be **true** by design. If you need to check for elasticsearch validity check the `OK` or `Acknowledged` properties where these apply.

`ConnectionStatus` holds the HttpStatusCode and various other interesting information in case a transport error occurred.

**NOTE** in most cases elasticsearch will throw a 500 and in that case `IsValid` will be false too. `ConnectionStatus.Result` will hold the error message as recieved from elasticsearch.
