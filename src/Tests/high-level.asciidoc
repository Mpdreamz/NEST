[[high-level]]
== High Level

A high level client that provides a strongly typed query DSL that maps one-to-one with the Elasticsearch query DSL 
and takes advantage of specific .NET features such as covariant results. 

NEST internally uses and still exposes the low level client, `ElasticLowLevelClient`, from <<low-level,Elasticsearch.Net>>

There are a number of conventions that NEST uses for inference of

- Field and Property names
- Document ids
- Building a URI path to a document
- Building a URI path to one or more indices
- Inferring
