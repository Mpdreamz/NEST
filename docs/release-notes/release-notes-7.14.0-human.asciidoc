=== MemoryStreamFactory Changes

In this release we have changed the value of DefaultMemoryStreamFactory in ConnectionConfiguration such that a new memory stream is used each time. This behavior is more predictable since instances will not be pooled leading to potentially large long-lived allocations. Instead, instances will be created on demand and once release, may be garbage collected. 

In advanced situations you may wish to configure the previous default and use the RecyclableMemoryStream.
