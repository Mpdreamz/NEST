[[children-aggregation]]
== Children Aggregation

A special single bucket aggregation that enables aggregating from buckets on parent document types to
buckets on child documents.

Be sure to read the elasticsearch documentation {ref_current}/search-aggregations-bucket-children-aggregation.html[on this subject here]

=== Fluent DSL Example

[source,csharp]
----
s => s
.Aggregations(aggs => aggs
	.Children<CommitActivity>("name_of_child_agg", child => child
		.Aggregations(childAggs => childAggs
			.Average("average_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
			.Max("max_per_child", avg => avg.Field(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
		)
	)
)
----

=== Object Initializer Syntax Example

[source,csharp]
----
new SearchRequest<Project>
{
	Aggregations = new ChildrenAggregation("name_of_child_agg", typeof(CommitActivity))
	{
		Aggregations = 
			new AverageAggregation("average_per_child", "confidenceFactor") &&
			new MaxAggregation("max_per_child", "confidenceFactor")
	}
}

new SearchRequest<Project>
{
	Aggregations = new ChildrenAggregation("name_of_child_agg", typeof(CommitActivity))
	{
		Aggregations =
			new AverageAggregation("average_per_child", Field<CommitActivity>(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
			&& new MaxAggregation("max_per_child", Field<CommitActivity>(p => p.ConfidenceFactor))
	}
}
