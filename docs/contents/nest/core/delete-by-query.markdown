# Delete by Query

	ConnectedClient.DeleteByQuery<object>(q => q.Query(rq => rq.Term(f => f.Name, "elasticsearch.pm")));

Elasticsearch allows you to delete over multiple types and indexes, so does NEST.

	ConnectedClient.DeleteByQuery<ElasticSearchProject>(q => q
		.Indices(new[] {"index1", "index2"})
		.Query(rq => rq.Term(f => f.Name, "elasticsearch.pm"))
	);

As always `*Async` variants are available too.

You can also delete by query over all the indices and types:

	ConnectedClient.DeleteByQuery<ElasticSearchProject>(q => q
		.AllIndices()
		.Query(rq => rq.Term(f => f.Name, "elasticsearch.pm"))
	);

The DeleteByQuery can be further controlled by passing a `DeleteByQueryParameters` object

	ConnectedClient.DeleteByQuery<ElasticSearchProject>(q => q
		.Query(rq => rq
		.Term(f => f.Name, "elasticsearch.pm"))
		.Routing("nest")
		.Replication(ReplicationOptions.Sync)
	);
