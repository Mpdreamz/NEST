# Connecting
This section describes how to instantiate a client and have it connect to the server.

## Basic plumbing:

	var elasticSettings = new ConnectionSettings(new Uri("http://127.0.0.1:9200"))
							  .SetDefaultIndex("mpdreamz");
	var client = new ElasticClient(elasticSettings);

## Connecting

Connecting can be done several ways:

	ConnectionStatus connectionStatus;
	if (client.TryConnect(out connectionStatus))

Or if you don't care about error reasons

	if (client.IsValid)

both will perform a one time lookup to see if ElasticSearch is available and ready. 

## Settings:
Settings can be set in a fluent fashion: `new ConnectionSettings().SetDefaultIndex().SetMaximumConnections()`

### DefaultIndex
Calling `SetDefaultIndex()` on `ConnectionSettings` will set the default index for the client. Whenever a method is called that doesn't explicitly passes an index this default will be used.

### MaximumAsyncConnections
Calling `SetMaximumAsyncConnections()` on `ConnectionSettings` will set the maximum async connections the client will send to ElasticSearch at the same time. If the maximum is hit the calls will be queued untill a slot becomes available.

### TypeNameInferrer
You can pass a `Func<string,string>` to SetTypeNameInferrer()` on `ConnectionSettings` to overide NEST's default behavior of lowercasing and pluralizing typenames.

### UsePrettyResponses
Setting `UsePrettyResponses()` on `ConnectionSettings` will append `pretty=true` to all the requests to inform ElasticSearch we want nicely formatted responses, setting this does **not** prettify requests themselves because bulk requests in ElasticSearch follow a very exact line delimited format.
