var searchResponse = client.Search<object>(s => s
    .AllIndices()
    .QueryOnQueryString("elasticsearch")
    .FilterPath("took", "hits.hits._id", "hits.hits._score") //<1>
);
----
<1> Using filter path can result in a response that cannot be parsed by the client's serializer. In these cases, using the low level client and parsing the JSON response may be preferred.
